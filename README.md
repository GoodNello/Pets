# Pets
Pets is a plugin for [OctoberCMS](http://octobercms.com/) that allows users to add pets to their profile and show them on a dedicated page.

This plugin requires [RainLab.User](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user).

## Development
I'm currently working in my free time on this plugin. As of now, you can only create and associate pets to users.
